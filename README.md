- divisible by 2 should be a square
- divisible by 3 should be a rectangle
- less than 10 and odd should be a triangle
- prime should be a circle if they are not divisible by 2, 3, or less than 10 and odd
- prime numbers from 0 - 100 is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.
- a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that have only two positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.
- if the number is odd the inside of the shape should be filled with green.
- if it is even it should be the shape should be transparent with a background color of red.
- background color of the shape should be gray if the number is greater than 50.
- if the number is greater than 50, the gray background should take priority over the red or green background of the even or odd numbers.

- The way this currently is set up, the number 9 shows up as a green rectangle and not a triangle with green filling.
- Because it is divisible by 3 which comes first in the checks & it is odd.
